<h1 align="center">Heap Data Structure </h1>

**Definition:** Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that is commonly used to implement priority queues. Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is
* always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes. This property is also called **_max heap property_**.
* always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes. This property is also called **_min heap property_**.


There are two types of Heap data structure:
1. Max Heap
2. Min Heap

## Max Heap 
 In a max-heap, the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children nodes.
